I wrote this based on Tyler Potts's video on Youtube, the link here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdlQJ7zHQK0

Don't forget to:
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

And don't forget to follow every CLI command from the video, because you may miss one or two line of code also maybe the library needed.
Hope it helps you.
